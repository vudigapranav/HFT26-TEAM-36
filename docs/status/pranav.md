# Pranav — status log

Newest entries at the bottom. Written by `/ship`.

## 2026-10-30 23:00 — prompts — add per-person checkpoint prompt files
- Changed: docs/prompts/KARTHIK_Codex_Prompts.md, docs/prompts/RITHVIK_Claude_Prompts.md, docs/prompts/PRANAV_Claude_Prompts.md (docs only, no code)
- Seams/contracts affected: none
- Teammates should know: your prompts for the 00:30 checkpoint are in docs/prompts/. K0 (BACKEND_DECISIONS.md) is still pending and blocks P1/R2 code.
- Next: P1 once K0 and K1a are merged

## 2026-10-30 23:32 — P4 — first-run rule for "real code change" in context §12
- Changed: docs/TorqueCode_Context.md §12 rule 4 (one sentence)
- Seams/contracts affected: none
- Teammates should know: for the first run, "previous hash" = hash of the untouched starter files, so running starter code unchanged doesn't count toward TestDiscipline.
- Next: P1 → P3 → P4 once K1a (contracts) is on main
